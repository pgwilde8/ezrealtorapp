# Offers that convert (pick one primary, keep one secondary)

* **Buyer primary:** “Personalized Listing Alerts in 60 Seconds” (they get a curated email within minutes)
* **Seller primary:** “Instant Home Value + 3-Step Sale Plan” (instant estimate + book consult)
* **Relocation angle:** “Neighborhood Match Quiz (3 mins)” → delivers a tailored area report
* **Investor angle:** “Cash-Flow Deals Digest (weekly)”

> Tip: lead with the *fastest* value you can deliver. Then ladder to a consult after they’ve gotten something useful.

# The form (short, smart, staged)

**Step 1 (above the fold):**

* Name
* Email
* “I’m a…” (Buyer / Seller / Both)
  [Continue →]

**Step 2 (modal or on-page):**

* For buyers: Target areas (chips), Budget range, Beds, Timeline (0–3 / 3–6 / 6–12 months)
* For sellers: Property address (autocomplete), Reason for selling, Timeline
* Consent checkboxes: “OK to text/call about my inquiry” + link to privacy
  **Submit copy:** “Create My Matches” / “Get My Price & Plan”

**Why staged?** You get the lead with Step 1; Step 2 boosts quality without scaring off hot prospects.

# Copy bank (steal these lines)

**Headlines**

* “Find the Right Home in {{City}} Without Wasting Weekends”
* “What’s Your {{Neighborhood}} Home Worth Today? Get a Plan in 5 Minutes.”
* “New to {{City}}? I’ll Match You to the 3 Best Neighborhoods for Your Life & Budget.”

**Subheads**

* “Daily alerts with only homes that fit—no spam, no zillow-scrolling spiral.”
* “You’ll get a price range, comps, and a 3-step plan to list when you’re ready.”

**CTA buttons**

* “Show Me My Matches” (buyer)
* “Get My Price” (seller)
* Secondary: “Book a 15-min strategy call”

**Proof bullets**

* “Average 12 days to offer (last 12 months)”
* “Verified off-market list shared weekly with clients”
* “$28M closed in {{City}} since 2016 (individual agent)”

---

# Visuals that increase trust

* **Neighborhood map with pins** of recent client closings (blur addresses)
* **Before/after**: staged listing vs. sale price delta
* **Screenshot preview** of the “alert email” or “valuation report” they’ll receive
* **Face + voice**: a 30-sec intro video: who you help, how you work, what happens after they submit

---

# Page variants by audience (so your message “clicks”)

* **First-time buyers:** emphasize guidance, explain lending pre-approval, timeline graphic
* **Move-up sellers:** emphasize pricing strategy, prep checklist, days-to-offer stat
* **Relocators:** neighborhood quiz + commute/time-to-airport, school snapshots
* **Investors:** cap rates, cash-on-cash examples, rent comps, “deal alerts”

---

# Follow-up flow (part of the “page” experience)

1. **Thank-you page** with: calendar embed to book a 15-min call + what happens next + social links
2. **Instant email/SMS**:

   * Buyers: “Got it—your matches are queued. Reply with ‘AUSTIN’ if that’s your top area.”
   * Sellers: “Here’s your preliminary value range; reply with your address to refine.”
3. **Day 2 nudge**: a useful tip (not a pushy pitch) + a single question
4. **Day 4**: invite to a quick call or send a local guide PDF

> Golden rule: every follow-up delivers value (a match, a stat, a checklist), not just “checking in.”

---

# Micro-FAQ (reduces form anxiety)

* “Will you spam me?” → “No. 1–2 helpful emails a week, unsubscribe anytime.”
* “Do I have to be pre-approved?” → “No. I can introduce lenders if you’d like.”
* “Are you the listing agent on these homes?” → “Sometimes—mostly I represent *you* as a buyer.”

---

# Credibility & compliance (quiet but visible)

* Broker/license #, Fair Housing logo
* “By submitting, you agree to be contacted by call/text/email. Msg & data rates may apply.”
* Link to Privacy Policy; keep it short and human

---

# A/B tests that usually move the needle

* **Primary CTA wording:** “Get My Price” vs. “See My Home’s Value”
* **Form length:** Name+Email vs. add Phone (test by source—ads vs. organic)
* **Offer framing:** “Instant value” vs. “Expert value + plan in 24 hours”
* **Social proof placement:** logos under hero vs. above the fold right of form
* **Hero image:** you + neighborhood backdrop vs. a generic house photo

---

# Speed & mobile (quiet conversion killers)

* Design for **one-hand mobile use** (big inputs, sticky CTA bar)
* Keep above-the-fold **<2.5s** load; compress images; no autoplay video on mobile
* Add a **sticky bottom bar CTA**: “Get My Matches” / “Get My Price”

---

# What to *not* do

* Don’t ask 12 fields up front (phone can be optional; earn it in Step 2 or via SMS opt-in).
* Don’t promise “instant CMA” if you can’t deliver something credible immediately.
* Don’t bury your contact info—some leads want to call now.
